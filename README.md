# subseq
*polyrhythmic sequencer for norns*

Subseq consists of two sequencers, each advanced by a pair of independent clock dividers. By default they are set up to send midi out to ch 1 and 2, but the internal engine can also be turned on for each one individually. 
Scale, root note, and basic set of engine params are accessible in the params menu.
